                                those are largely unhelpful phrases that mean very little when you're starting your

                                and you want to make sure the functionality you’ve developed will always work, no matter
                                what additional features are added in the future. Option A – manually testing. Every
                                time you add new code, take hours and hours to click around and make sure everything
                                still works as before. Option B – automated testing. Write some code that, at the push
                                of a button, can simulate a human interacting with your application to perform the same
                                tests as option A while you spend your time elsewhere. Which option would you choose?

                                In this workshop, we’ll start with some data and a question we want to answer. We'll
                                then take a winding journey though how to answer that question using a variety of tools.
                                We'll start with the Linux shell and learn some ninja-level data munging tricks. Next
                                we'll step into the world of big data and explore our data using MapReduce, then Spark,
                                and finally Hive. When we're done, attendees will have a high level understanding of the
                                current most popular data analysis tools and some hands-on experience to back it up. All
                                work will be done on a Docker image that is preloaded with the data and the tools we
                                will use. All coding will be done in python. Attendees should come with a laptop with
                                Docker preinstalled and should ideally have the Docker image (templedf/phdata:latest)
                                pulled.
